about=Geometry Comparator is a QGIS processing tool designed to compare two vector layers of the same geometry type (Polygon, Line, or Point). It analyzes differences based on a specified Unique ID field and geometry, accurately identifying Added, Deleted, and Modified features. The tool ensures robust change detection by prioritizing geometry comparison, handling cases where IDs may change, and supports all geometry types with precise matching logic.
